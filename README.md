# project2

I am in group 6 with Lucas and Moises. We helped each other if needed, but otherwise we wrote the code for each of our files ourselves. 

Data were imported into postgres tables using the import/export function. 

Note, after I submitted my homework, I noticed that I didn't submit the right files, so I updated my files at 10:26 pm Central.
